\chapter{State of the Art of Formal Verification}

% Formal verification consists in proving the correctness of a system,
% characterized by a mathematical model, with respect to certain properties,
% defined as logic formula.
%%
% The result of decades of academic researches and industrial investments is a
% large collection of complementary
% formalisms\,\cite{berthomieu1991petri,mcmillan1989compositional,baeten2005processalgebra,emmi2008interfaceautomata,hoare1969hoare,reynolds2002separation}
% to model systems and defined properties of interest, and
% tools\,\cite{cuoq2012framac,coq,cimatti2002nusmv,jackson2012alloy} to assist
% and automate the verification process.
%%
% This allowed for applying formal verification to a broad variety of computer
% science domains, including cryptographic
% protocols\,\cite{goubault2000crypto,meadows2003crypto},
% compilers\,\cite{leroy2012compcert}, system software
% component\,\cite{klein2009sel4,gu2016certikos} or hardware
% designs\,\cite{lie2003xom,kaivola2009formalintel,reid2016armv8}.
%%
% With regard to \ac{hse} mechanisms, they fall between two domains that are
% hardware design verification and low-level software components verification.
%%
% On the one hand, hardware designs verification often focus on properties
% transparent to the executed software components (\emph{e.g.} cache
% coherency\,\cite{stern1995cachecoherence}, linearizability of SGX
% instructions\,\cite{leslie2015sgx}, hardware-based memory
% isolation\,\cite{lie2003xom}).
%%
% Security gap in interactions of multiple platform components are less subject
% to formal verification, due to their increasing
% complexity\,\cite{potlapally2011hardwaresecurity}.
%%
% Yet they are responsible for architectural attacks we want to avoid.
%%
% On the other hand, low-level software components such as
% seL4\,\cite{klein2009sel4} or CertiKOS\,\cite{gu2016certikos} use the features
% exposed by these components, and are verified against \emph{ad hoc} hardware
% models, whose scope is often limited to necessary hardware features.
%%
%% For our part, we would rather characterize a set of sufficient requirements
%% over low-level software components, such that any software implementation
%% which satisfy these requirements and is executed by the hardware architecture
%% proves to be correct with respect to a targeted property.
%%
% We steer a middle course between these approaches.
%%
% For our part, we would rather characterize sets of requirements over low-level
% software components, such that satisfying these requirements is sufficient to
% ensure the hardware architecture enforces a certain property.
%%
% As a first step, we can verify the correctness of these requirements against a
% hardware model.
%%
% The long term goal of this approach is to focus the verification of low-level
% software components on proving they satisfy these requirements.
%%
% As such, our approach relates to previous research works such as
% RockSalt\,\cite{morrisett2012rocksalt} (validation of arbitrary programs
% against a verified software-based fault isolation\,\cite{wahbe1994sfi} policy)
% or Moat\,\cite{sinha2015moat} (verification of SGX
% enclave\,\cite{costan2016sgxexplained} programs with respect to
% confidentiality).
%
% The rest of this Chapter proceeds as follow.
%%
% First, we give an opinionated introduction to the formal verification of
% hardware and software components with respect to security properties, with
% respect to our objectives (Section~\ref{?}).
%%
% Then, we give a review of several industrial and academic projects which
% implements these approaches (Section~\ref{?}).
%%
% Finally,

Formal verification consists in proving the correctness of a system ---the
\emph{Implementation}--- with respect to certain properties.
%
To that end, a verifier
%
\begin{inparaenum}[(1)]
\item defines a formal description of the system ---the \emph{Specification}---,
  %
\item exhibits a proof that a formal description of the system satisfies a
  statement (defined in an arbitrary logic) which encodes the property with
  respect to which the correctness shall be proven, and
  %
\item exhibits a proof of correspondence between the implementation and the
  specification.
\end{inparaenum}
%
In this context, the terms ``implementation'' and ``specification'' refer to a
subjective relation between two layers of abstraction: the specification is more
abstract than its implementation, and formal verification proofs can be
organized in an arbitrary number of abstraction layers
%
The definition of a specification shall ease the construction of the proof of
correctness, while the correspondence proof allows for extending the properties
of the specification to the implementation.
%
The instantiation of the terms ``formal description'', ``correspondence proof'',
``properties'' or ``correctness proof'' may considerably vary from one system to
another.
%
Similarly, the nature of the proofs and their construction greatly depend on the
tools used by the verifier.
%
For our part, we want to construct correctness proofs of a hardware architecture
specification, with respect to security properties, and using the Coq theorem
prover (as explained in Chapter~\ref{chap:introduction}).
%
The rest of this Chapter is organized with this objective in mind

First, we describe popular formalisms used to define formal descriptions of
hardware specifications (Section~\ref{sec:sota:formalisms}).
%
Then, we focus on the encoding of security properties as logic statements
(Section~\ref{sec:sota:security}).
%
Finally, we give an overview of related works
(Section~\ref{sec:sota:relatedwork}).
% and we conclude this Chapter by positioning our contributions in that respect
% (Section~\ref{...}).

\section{Transition Systems}
\label{sec:sota:formalisms}

The formal verification of discrete systems, such as computing systems, commonly
rely on some sort of \emph{transition systems} to describe the behavior of the
target.
%
More precisely, the system is characterized by a set of \emph{states} and by a
set of \emph{atomic} state-transformation, called \emph{transitions}.
%
Transitions occur when the system interacts with its environment (\emph{e.g.} a
hardware circuit receives a clock signal, a hardware controller receives a
message from a bus, an operating system handles a syscall).
%
Additionally, \emph{labeled} transition systems distinguish between classes of
transitions \emph{via} the use of labels (\emph{e.g.} one label per syscall).

To the best of our knowledge, the more straightforward definition of a labeled
transition system, as used by Vijayaraghavan \emph{et al.} in their work on
modular verification of multiprocessor hardware
designs\,\cite{vijayaraghavan2015modular}, is a tuple
\( \langle S, L, R \rangle \), such that \( S \) is a set of states, \( L \) is
a set of labels, and \( R \subseteq S \times L \times S \) is the transition
relation.

\begin{example}[Airlock System]
  Figure~\ref{fig:sota:airlock-lts} illustrates an instantiation of this
  definition for a simple airlock system.
  %
  An airlock system is a device made of two doors, and an intermediary chamber.
  %
  To get across a airlock system, a user requests the opening of the first door,
  enters the chamber, waits for the system to close the first door and open the
  second door, and exits the chamber.

  \begin{itemize}
  \item A door of the system can be either \( \mathtt{open} \) or
    \( \mathtt{close} \).
    %
    The set of states of the airlock system reflects the combinatronics of the
    doors states.
  \item A transition is characterized by the opening (\( \mathtt{Open}_i\), with
    \( i \in \{1, 2\} \)) and closing (\( \mathtt{Close}_i \), with
    \( i \in \{1, 2\} \)) of a door of the system.
    %
  \item The system does not allow the simultaneous opening of both doors, as
    stated by the definition of \( R \) which does not contains a transition
    which leads to the state \( (\mathtt{open}, \mathtt{open}) \).
  \end{itemize}
\end{example}

\end{figure}

There are many modeling structures one can use to characterize transition
systems, with each variant better suited to tackle a particular class of
systems.
%
For instance, the Kripke structure\,\cite{kripke1971semantical} is a notorious
variation of (labeled) transition systems used in model
checking\,\cite{clarke1999model}, while Petri net\,\cite{peterson1981petri},
process algebra\,\cite{bergstra1984process} or interface
automata\,\cite{de2001interface} are better suited to model concurrent systems.
