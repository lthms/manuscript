\chapter{A Formal Definition of HSE Mechanisms in Coq}

This Appendix presents in depth an implementation of the formal definition of
HSE mechanisms detailed in Chapter~\ref{chapter:speccert}, and follows a similar
outline.
%
The main purpose of the presented development is to provide rigorous,
machine-checked proofs of the Lemma~\ref{lemma:speccert:hseinv} and the
Theorem~\ref{theorem:speccert:correcthse}.
%
The sketch proofs given in Chapter~\ref{chapter:speccert} are manual
verbalization of the {\sc Ltac} script proofs.
