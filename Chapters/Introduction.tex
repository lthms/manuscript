\vspace{1cm}\noindent To manage complexity, computing platforms are commonly
built as succession of abstraction layers, from the hardware architecture up to
the applications used by end users.
%
Each layer leverages the interface of its predecessor to expose a higher-level,
more constrained set of functionalities for its successors.
%
This enables separation of concerns ---each layer encapsulates one dimension of
the overall complexity--- and modularity ---two layers which expose the same
interface can be seamlessly interchange---.

From a security perspective, a layer is often \emph{more privileged} than, and
therefore implicitly trusted by, its successors.
%
More precisely, the former constrains the latter, with respect to targeted
security properties.
%
For instance, an operating system shares hardware resources among several
applications, and therefore is able to enforce availability ---fair share of CPU
time---, confidentiality and integrity ---exclusive partition of physical
memories--- properties.

This makes \emph{isolation} a key security property.
%
In the context of this thesis, we say one component $A$ is said isolated from a
second component $B$ when $B$ cannot tamper with $A$'s functioning otherwise
than through its interface.
%
Thus, an operating system should be isolated from end users applications, to
prevent the latter to grant themselves abusive rights.
%
The opposite is not necessarily true, and it is even a common practice for
operating system to tamper with applications code (\emph{e.g.} address space
layout randomization, dynamic libraries).

Isolation can be achieved in various ways.
%
Yet, concerning the lowest layers of abstraction, the common approach is to rely
on mechanisms provided by the hardware architecture.
