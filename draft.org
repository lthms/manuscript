* Summary of Contributions

Two contributions:

- Specifying and Verifying HSE (SpecCert)
- Modular verification of multi-components system (FreeSpec)

Link between them: SpecCert requires a model of the hardware architecture, but
the scale of mainstream architectures (x86) remains challenging.

* Manuscript [0/4]

** TODO Hardware-based Security Enforcement mechanisms [0/3]

*** TODO HSE Definition

*** TODO HSE IRL + Architectural Attacks

- [REMARK] /micro/-architectural attacks are out of scope

*** TODO Thesis Approach

- Formal approach to specify and verify HSE which benefits to hw and sw people.


** TODO Related Works

- Not only writing correct HW: ARM, Intel, Kami, Secure Processor (XOM, etc.)
- But also defining how to use them: RockSalt, Moat
- [QUESTION] should we leave the “modular” thing in FreeSpec chapter?
